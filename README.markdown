## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not bump version. (If you want to have your own version, that is
  fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull).
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
